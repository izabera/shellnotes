- in a new shell, $status is false and exit causes an exit code 1
- inconsistent parser(?)
  - ~ can tell whether its args were quoted or not
- if not   <- ew.
- lack of every useful feature
  - not even echo
  - not even job control, ffs
    - ^Z breaks everything
  - reading input line by line requires an external read that doesn't buffer
    - tom duff shows a naive read, awk likely buffers

      it can't be used in a while loop anyway because of its exit status
  - expr is the only way to increment a number
- all variables are exported
- ALL FUNCTIONS are exported   <- ewww.
- local variables with  var = value cmd
  - functions can't declare new local variables
- very newline sensitive
  - switch cases need \n before and after
  - arrays can't have newlines between elements
  - while ( ) can have newlines, for ( ) can't
- x = var for ($x in a b c) echo $var  <- some sort of indirection?
- list = ( a b c ) for ( $"list in x ) echo x  <- accepts invalid names
- allows $x $$x $$$x, even $`{echo x}
